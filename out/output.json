The Setup:\n\nLegitimate Executable Installation: The Goofy Guineapig loader installs a legitimate executable (in this case, GoogleUpdate.exe) as part of a seemingly normal installation process. This executable is often signed, making it appear trustworthy.\nMalicious DLL Placement:  Simultaneously, the loader installs a malicious DLL (the \"Goofy Guineapig\" DLL) in a location that is accessible to the legitimate executable.\n\n2. The Hijack:\n\nExecution Flow: When the legitimate executable (e.g., GoogleUpdate.exe) is run, the operating system loads any DLLs specified in its dependencies.\nSide-Loading:  The malicious DLL is included in the legitimate executable's dependencies, either directly or through a clever manipulation of the executable's structure.\nDLL Injection: As the legitimate executable loads, the malicious DLL is injected into its memory space. This effectively gives the malicious code control over the legitimate process.\n\n3. The Consequences:\n\nCommand and Control: The malicious DLL can now communicate with a command-and-control (C2) server, allowing the attacker to remotely control the infected system.\nData Exfiltration: The malicious DLL can steal sensitive information from the infected system and send it back to the attacker.\nFurther Malicious Activity: The attacker can use the compromised process to install additional malware, launch attacks, or perform other malicious actions.\n\nKey Points:\n\nStealth: DLL side-loading is a stealthy technique because the malicious code is hidden within a legitimate process.\nTrust:  The attacker exploits the trust users have in legitimate software to gain a foothold on their systems.\nPersistence:  Goofy Guineapig's use of a Windows service ensures that the malicious DLL remains loaded even after the user logs off or restarts their computer.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.", "mitre_technique": {"id": "T1574.002", "name": "Hijack execution flow: dll side-loading", "description": "Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs.

This makes it harder to detect and analyze the transmitted data.\n\n\nTransmission:  Goofy Guineapig transmits this obfuscated \"Authorization\" string with each C2 communication, effectively sending the system information to its controllers.\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about Goofy Guineapig's tactics or techniques.

HTTPS encrypts the communication between the infected machine and the C2 server, making it harder to intercept and analyze.\n\n\nNon-Standard Port:  Goofy Guineapig deviates from the standard HTTPS port (443) and instead communicates over port 4443. This non-standard port helps the malware evade detection by security tools that might be primarily focused on monitoring traffic on the standard HTTPS port.\n\n\nObscured Information:  Within the HTTPS communication, Goofy Guineapig obfuscates system information and sends it to the C2 server as part of the \"Authorization\" string in the HTTP header. This further complicates analysis and tracking of the malware's activities.\n\n\nThis combination of HTTPS, a non-standard port, and obfuscation techniques allows Goofy Guineapig to establish a secure and covert communication channel with its C2 server, enabling it to receive commands and exfiltrate stolen data.

This protocol is connectionless and offers faster transmission speeds but lacks reliability and guaranteed delivery.\n\n\nKCP:  Goofy Guineapig can also use the KCP (Kylix Crypto Protocol) for communication. KCP is a fast and reliable protocol designed for low-latency, high-throughput applications. It offers features like congestion control and packet loss recovery, making it suitable for scenarios where network conditions are unpredictable.\n\n\nDirect Socket Communications:  Goofy Guineapig has the capability to perform direct socket communications. This allows it to establish a raw connection with a Command and Control (C2) server without relying on established protocols like UDP or KCP. The specific details of these direct socket communications, such as the ports used, are likely determined by the embedded configuration string.\n\n\nThe choice of fallback channel is likely determined dynamically based on factors like network availability, latency, and the specific configuration of the malware.\nLet me know if you have any other questions about Goofy Guineapig or malware analysis in general.
