The Goofy Guineapig malware uses the `rundll32.exe` binary, which is a legitimate Windows system binary, to execute a malicious DLL.\n2. The malware loads the `url.dll` library, which is also a legitimate Windows system library, into memory.\n3. The `url.dll` library is used to load the malicious DLL into memory, and then the `rundll32.exe` binary is used to execute the loaded DLL.\n\nThis technique allows the Goofy Guineapig malware to bypass traditional security measures that might detect or block the execution of a malicious executable file. Instead, it uses legitimate system binaries and libraries to load and execute the malicious code, making it more difficult for security software to detect.\n\nIn this case, the \"Signed Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32\" technique is used by Goofy Guineapig to persist on the compromised system, allowing it to maintain a presence on the system even after the initial infection vector has been removed."
