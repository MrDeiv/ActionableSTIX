Here are the specific details:\n\n1. **HTTP and HTTPS communications**: Document '5754d55d-02ae-4131-9145-d2604d8fd659' mentions that the backdoor supports multiple communications methods, including HTTP and HTTPS.\n2. **KCP protocol**: Document '5754d55d-02ae-4131-9145-d2604d8fd659' also mentions that the backdoor supports the KCP protocol, which is used for UDP communications.\n3. **Raw TCP socket communications**: Document 'ff1fafc8-0866-4e69-bebb-d7f1e324e54c' mentions that the binary also supports raw TCP socket communications.\n4. **UDP communications**: Document 'ff1fafc8-0866-4e69-bebb-d7f1e324e54c' and Document 'T1008  Fallback Channels' mention that Goofy Guineapig contains the functionality to communicate using UDP and the KCP protocol.\n5. **Non-standard HTTPS port 4443**: Document 'T1571 Non-Standard Port' mentions that Goofy Guineapig communicates over the non-standard HTTPS port 4443.\n\nIn summary, Goofy Guineapig has the capability to communicate with external servers using various protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, KCP, UDP, and raw TCP socket communications."}, "os": {"value": "The necessary operating system to run the malware is: **Windows**", "summary": "After analyzing the provided text, I have inferred that the necessary operating system to run the malware is Windows.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Document(id='5754d55d-02ae-4131-9145-d2604d8fd659', page_content='... Goofy Guineapig maintains persistence as a Windows service.') - This line explicitly mentions \"Windows service\", indicating that the malware targets Windows.\n* Document(id='44a46016-da82-4c02-b34b-ae3974f07c3e', page_content='...

This is an example of **Lure** vulnerability, where the malware tricks the user into running a seemingly legitimate software.\n2. **Process hollowing**: The malware has the option to perform process hollowing on the dllhost.exe process, allowing it to appear as if the payload executable is running under a legitimate process path and name (Document metadata={}). This technique exploits the **Elevation of Privilege** vulnerability, where the malware gains elevated privileges by masquerading as a legitimate process.\n3. **Time-based evasion**: The malware reads the CPU timestamp counter to evade detection by dynamic analysis tools (Document metadata={}). This is an example of **Anti-dynamic analysis**, where the malware attempts to detect and evade analysis tools.\n4. **Basic anti-sandbox/anti-VM techniques**: The malware checks for physical memory size and disk size to detect if it's running in a sandbox or VM environment (Document metadata={}). This is an example of **Sandbox detection** vulnerability, where the malware attempts to detect and evade sandbox environments.\n\nThe Goofy Guineapig malware also uses various evasion techniques, including:\n\n* Defence evasion techniques similar to those used by Jolly Jellyfish malware\n* Multiple communications methods, including HTTP, HTTPS, and KCP\n* Use of a hardcoded default beacon in case the primary communication method fails\n\nOverall, the Goofy Guineapig malware exploits several vulnerabilities and uses various evasion techniques to evade detection."}, "actions": []}, {"actions": []}, {"actions": []}, {"actions": []}]
