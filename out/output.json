The extracted contents include a legitimate binary (e.g., url.dll) and a malicious DLL.\n4. The Goofy Guineapig persistence mechanism uses `rundll32.exe` to execute the legitimate binary, which is `url.dll`.\n5. `Rundll32.exe` loads the `url.dll` library, which in turn loads the malicious DLL.\n\nThis process allows the malicious DLL to be loaded into memory without being detected as a standalone executable, thereby evading traditional security measures.
