Here's a breakdown of how the malware delivery process works based on the provided context:\n\n1. Phishing or deceptive links: The campaign likely starts with phishing emails or deceptive links that appear to be legitimate or related to the user's interests. These links may be sent to potential victims via email, social media, or other communication channels. The goal is to trick users into clicking on the malicious link, which leads them to a compromised website or a malicious file.\n\n2. Trojanized Google Chrome Updater (SICKMAN): Once the user clicks on the malicious link, they are directed to a website hosting the trojanized Google Chrome Updater, also known as SICKMAN.

Specifically, it leverages the Service Control Manager to create or modify a legitimate Windows service, in this case, GoogleUpdate.exe, which is typically associated with the Google Update service.\n\nThe attack begins with the execution of a malicious DLL, which is loaded into the legitimate dllhost.exe process. This process is a critical component of the Windows operating system, responsible for hosting dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). By injecting a malicious payload into this process, the attacker can effectively control it and execute arbitrary code within the context of the system's security privileges.\n\nOnce the payload is executed, the Goofy Guineapig backdoor alters the thread context of the dllhost.exe process, effectively changing its execution flow. This allows the malicious code to resume execution, leading to the creation of a suspended state of the process. In this state, the process's memory is written with new data, which includes the malicious payload.\n\nTo maintain persistence, the backdoor spawns a new instance of the dll", "indicators": " - EventID: 7045\n  Description: Service Control Manager event indicating the creation of a new service named 'GoogleUpdate'\n\n- ImagePath: C:\\ProgramData\\GoogleUpdate\\GoogleUpdate.exe\n  Description: Path to the malicious executable that is being registered as a Windows service\n\n- Provider_Name: Service Control Manager\n  Description: The service provider responsible for managing Windows services\n\n- ServiceName: GoogleUpdate\n  Description: Name of the service being registered, which is typically associated with legitimate Google software updates\n\n- Rundll32: FileProtocolHandler\n  Description: Indicator of DLL side-loading, where 'rundll32' is used to load a DLL from a file protocol handler\n\n- URL: (Obfuscated URL in 'Authorization' string HTTP header)\n  Description: Obfuscated URL used in C2 communication, indicating the presence of command and control traffic\n\n- File Deletion: Initial download location\n  Description: Indicator of file deletion activity, suggesting the removal of files after initial execution\n\n- Process Hollowing: dllhost.exe\n  Description: Indicator of process hollowing,"}, {"name": "Windows Service", "description": " In the context of cybersecurity threats, adversaries often exploit the Windows Service mechanism to establish persistent access within compromised systems. By leveraging system utilities such as sc.exe and Registry editing tools, they can manipulate service configurations to initiate malicious activities upon system startup. This manipulation includes altering service file paths, recovery programs, or commands to execute harmful payloads.\n\nAdversaries may also employ masquerading techniques, disguising their malicious services as legitimate ones associated with related operating systems or benign software. This tactic complicates detection efforts, as the malicious service blends in with legitimate system processes.\n\nFurthermore, adversaries can modify existing services, potentially disrupting their intended functionality or enabling disabled services to run. This not only aids in persistence but also in privilege escalation, as services executed under SYSTEM privileges can be used to elevate an attacker's access from administrator to SYSTEM level.\n\nAnother method involves directly starting services, bypassing standard service management protocols. This approach, known as Service Execution, allows adversaries to initiate their malicious services without the need for registry modifications", "indicators": " 1.

This technique is akin to DLL Search Order Hijacking, where the attacker manipulates the order in which DLLs are loaded by a program. However, DLL Side-Loading goes a step further by directly invoking a trusted application, which then executes the adversary's payload.\n\nThe attacker strategically places both the legitimate application and the malicious DLL in proximity, leveraging the application's inherent trust to execute the payload without immediate detection. This method allows the adversary to perform actions under the guise of a trusted process, potentially gaining elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.\n\nTo effectively carry out this attack, adversaries may employ various tactics. They might use benign executables as a cover, which are less likely to raise suspicion during delivery and execution. Additionally, the malicious payloads are often encrypted or obfuscated, ensuring that they remain undetected until they are loaded into the memory space of the trusted process.\n\nThe implications of DLL Side-Loading", "indicators": " 1.
