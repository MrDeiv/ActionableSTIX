This suggests that the malware is using a trusted application as a vector to execute its payload.\n\n2. The malware checks the running location (C:\\ProgramData\\GoogleUpdate) to determine if it should start persistence. This implies that the malware is designed to run on a specific system and may not necessarily require an internet connection to perform its initial actions.\n\n3. The malware is described as a \"NSIS installer trojanized Firefox installer,\" which indicates that it may be using a packaging tool (NSIS) to create a self-extracting archive. This could potentially be distributed offline, without the need for an internet connection.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not clear whether an internet connection is required for the malware attack to complete. The malware may have been designed to operate offline, using the trusted application and specific system location as part of its attack strategy. However, further analysis", "delivery": " Based on the provided context, it appears that the malware is delivered to the target machine through a deceptive method involving fake browser update notices. Here's a breakdown of the delivery process:\n\n1. Phishing or social engineering: The attackers create fake browser update notices that appear legitimate and convincing. These notices may be sent via email, social media, or other communication channels. The goal is to trick the target into believing that their browser requires an urgent update.\n\n2. Clicking on the fake update link: Once the target clicks on the link provided in the fake update notice, they are redirected to a malicious website or landing page. This website is designed to look authentic and may even use the same branding or logo as the legitimate browser developer.\n\n3. Exploiting vulnerabilities: The malicious website or landing page may contain exploit kits or zero-day vulnerabilities that target the target's browser or operating system. When the target interacts with the malicious content, the exploit takes advantage of the vulnerability to execute the malware payload.\n\n4.

Specifically, it leverages the Service Control Manager to create or modify a legitimate Windows service, in this case, GoogleUpdate.exe, which is typically associated with the Google Update service.\n\nThe attack begins with the execution of a malicious DLL, which is loaded into the legitimate dllhost.exe process. This process is a critical component of the Windows operating system, responsible for hosting dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). By injecting a malicious payload into this process, the attacker can effectively control it and execute arbitrary code within the context of the system's security privileges.\n\nOnce the payload is executed, the Goofy Guineapig backdoor alters the thread context of the dllhost.exe process, effectively changing its execution flow. This allows the malicious code to resume execution, leading to the creation of a suspended state of the process. In this state, the process's memory is written with new data, which includes the malicious payload.\n\nTo maintain persistence, the backdoor spawns a new instance of the dll", "indicators": " - EventID: 7045\n  Description: Service Control Manager event indicating the creation of a new service named 'GoogleUpdate'\n\n- ImagePath: C:\\ProgramData\\GoogleUpdate\\GoogleUpdate.exe\n  Description: Path to the malicious executable that is being registered as a Windows service\n\n- Provider_Name: Service Control Manager\n  Description: The service provider responsible for managing Windows services\n\n- ServiceName: GoogleUpdate\n  Description: Name of the service being registered, which is typically associated with legitimate Google software updates\n\n- Rundll32: FileProtocolHandler\n  Description: Indicator of DLL side-loading, where 'rundll32' is used to load a DLL from a file protocol handler\n\n- URL: (Obfuscated URL in 'Authorization' string HTTP header)\n  Description: Obfuscated URL used in C2 communication, indicating the presence of command and control traffic\n\n- File Deletion: Initial download location\n  Description: Indicator of file deletion activity, suggesting the removal of files after initial execution\n\n- Process Hollowing: dllhost.exe\n  Description: Indicator of process hollowing,"}, {"name": "Windows Service", "description": " In the context of cybersecurity threats, adversaries often exploit the Windows Service mechanism to establish persistent access within compromised systems. By leveraging system utilities such as sc.exe and Registry editing tools, they can manipulate service configurations to initiate malicious activities upon system startup. This manipulation includes altering service file paths, recovery programs, or commands to execute harmful payloads.\n\nAdversaries may also employ masquerading techniques, disguising their malicious services as legitimate ones associated with related operating systems or benign software. This tactic complicates detection efforts, as the malicious service blends in with legitimate system processes.\n\nFurthermore, adversaries can modify existing services, potentially disrupting their intended functionality or enabling disabled services to run. This not only aids in persistence but also in privilege escalation, as services executed under SYSTEM privileges can be used to elevate an attacker's access from administrator to SYSTEM level.\n\nAnother method involves directly starting services, bypassing standard service management protocols. This approach, known as Service Execution, allows adversaries to initiate their malicious services without the need for registry modifications", "indicators": " 1.

This technique is akin to DLL Search Order Hijacking, where the attacker manipulates the order in which DLLs are loaded by a program. However, DLL Side-Loading goes a step further by directly invoking a trusted application, which then executes the adversary's payload.\n\nThe attacker strategically places both the legitimate application and the malicious DLL in proximity, leveraging the application's inherent trust to execute the payload without immediate detection. This method allows the adversary to perform actions under the guise of a trusted process, potentially gaining elevated privileges or access to sensitive data.\n\nTo effectively carry out this attack, adversaries may employ various tactics. They might use benign executables as a cover, which are less likely to raise suspicion during delivery and execution.
