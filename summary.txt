In December 1903, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honored Pierre Curie, Marie Curie, and Henri Becquerel with the Nobel Prize in Physics for their groundbreaking research on radiation phenomena, a discovery made by Professor Henri Becquerel. Initially, the committee was set to award only Pierre Curie and Becquerel, but Marie Curie's nomination was advocated for by Magnus Gï¿½sta Mittag-Leffler, leading to her inclusion as the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize.  Despite their commitment to their research and Pierre Curie's disinclination towards public ceremonies, the Curies eventually made the trip to Stockholm in 1905 to receive the prize and deliver a lecture, as required for Nobel laureates.  Furthermore, the Nobel Prize's monetary award enabled the Curies to hire their first laboratory assistant, a significant step in their scientific endeavors. The University of Paris, responding to Pierre Curie's complaints, agreed to provide a new laboratory, although it would not be ready until 1906. This development further solidified the Curies' position in the scientific community, as they were offered a professorship and the chair of physics at the University of Paris, despite still lacking a proper laboratory at the time.
