Exploitation is initiated through the transmission of malicious SNMP packets leveraging CVE-2017-6742 to the target device's public IP address.\n\nIn instances where the target utilizes SNMP versions 2c or earlier, exploitation may be facilitated by known default or publicly accessible community strings, circumventing authentication mechanisms.  For SNMP version 3, valid user credentials for the affected system are required for successful exploitation.\n\nSuccessful exploitation of the vulnerability grants the attacker remote code execution (RCE) capabilities and write access to the target operating system. This enables the arbitrary execution of code on the target system and modification of files and data. Subsequently, the attacker deploys the Jaguar Tooth malware onto the compromised device utilizing the acquired RCE and write access. \n\n\n", "mitre_technique": {"id": "T1190", "name": "Exploit public-facing application", "description": "Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network.
