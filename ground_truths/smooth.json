If the 3CX process exits and starts again, Smooth Operator reads this initial beacon time from the file to which it was written, meaning the time will not reset on process restart. After the initial beacon, Smooth Operator uses a time-seeded random algorithm to generate a default beacon interval of between 1 and 2 hours. The sleep interval between beacons is freshly calculated at the start of every beacon cycle, but can be updated per cycle through tasking.  The initial beacon time is overwritten with the next beacon time in the .main_storage file at the end of every beacon cycle."
